//! Shared offline-cache → bytes resolver (frontend-agnostic).
//!
//! This is the OFFLINE tier of the playback tier-walk. Both frontends slot
//! it in BEFORE the network tier in their play path; `qbz-player` (which
//! already owns L1/L2 + the network/CMAF pipeline) stays untouched.
//!
//! - Tauri's `v2_play_track` / `v2_play_next_gapless` resolve offline bytes
//!   through this helper (keeping their hardware-compatibility / quality
//!   gating around the returned bytes).
//! - Slint's play path calls it before `Player::play_track`.

///   When `sink` is `Some`, `UnlockStart`/`UnlockEnd` are emitted around the
///   decrypt so a frontend can show an "unlocking" hint on the row.
/// - `cache_format = 1` (legacy plain FLAC) → read the file directly.
/// - no ready row / any failure → `None` (the caller treats it as a cache
///   miss and continues to the next tier / the network).

/// Offline copies are always downloaded at the top quality tier, so there is
/// no quality gate here; a frontend that must honor a hardware limit (e.g.
/// the Tauri ALSA path) applies its own check to the returned bytes.
