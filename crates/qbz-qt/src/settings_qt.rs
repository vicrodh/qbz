//! Settings > Audio + Playback controller — Slint-free port of
//! `crates/qbz/src/settings.rs` onto the SAME public backend stores:
//! `AudioSettingsStore` (get/set + `Player::reload_settings` /
//! `Player::reinit_device` apply — the audio backend is PROTECTED: only
//! these public calls), `PlaybackPreferencesStore`, the shared
//! `ui_prefs.json` (streaming quality), and the shared QConnect settings seam.
//!
//! Also owns device enumeration (`BackendManager::create_backend(type)
//! .enumerate_devices()` — public) with the Tauri ALSA section grouping,
//! and the cross-setting cascades from settings.rs (dac-passthrough,
//! streaming-only, backend switch).
//!
//! The Detected device limit row (#638 fix 3) IS wired (2026-08-17): the probe
//! and its cache moved out of the Slint binary crate into
//! `qbz_app::device_cap`, `refresh_device_cap` below owns the six explicit
//! triggers, and the row reads the cache off the snapshot.
//!
//! (The HiFi Wizard, the JACK banner and settings export/import were on this
//! list and are all shipped now — `qml/settings/DacWizardModal.qml`,
//! `AudioSettings.qml:70-78` and `settings_qt/devtools.rs`.)
//! - QConnect startup/device-name values use the transport module's one DB
//!   implementation; device-name edits also update the live service cache and
//!   take effect on the next connection, like upstream.

// touch ui_prefs.json. (theme_qt.rs and search_qt.rs each carried a private
// copy of both anti-patterns until they were routed through here.)
//
// The same `read_json_object` + `write_json_object_atomic` pair covers the
// other documents this crate co-owns with the Slint app: `myqbz_branding.json`
// (below) and `locallibrary_ui.json` (local_state.rs).
//
// STILL TRUNCATING, in files this module does not own — same failure mode,
// smaller blast radius, listed so the next sweep has the list rather than a
// claim: recently_qt.rs (`recently_played.json`, Slint `recently.rs`),
// genre_filter_qt.rs (`genre_filter.json`, Slint `genre_filter.rs`),
// lyrics_qt.rs (`lyrics_prefs.json`, Slint `lyrics_prefs.rs`) and
// playlist_qt.rs (`playlist_orders.json`, Qt-only — races only itself).
//
// ui_prefs.json is co-owned with the SHIPPING Slint app and both processes do
// a whole-document read-modify-write, so two rules decide whether the file
// survives concurrency:
//
// 1. NEVER publish a partial file. `std::fs::write` opens O_TRUNC, so between
//    the truncate and the last byte the file on disk is short or empty. Slint's
//    `ui_prefs::load()` (crates/qbz/src/ui_prefs.rs:872-883) answers a parse
//    failure with `UiPrefs::default()`, and its next `save()` writes those
//    defaults back — one unlucky read inside our write window wipes theme,
//    npb_mode, streaming_quality, cast_quality_caps, renderer, the lot. Writing
//    a sibling temp file and `rename(2)`-ing it onto the target closes the
//    window: rename within one directory is atomic on Linux, so a concurrent
//    reader sees either the whole old document or the whole new one.
//    Window geometry is what made this urgent: it saves on every settled
//    resize, orders of magnitude more often than a settings toggle.
//
// 2. NEVER rebuild the document from scratch. The old fallback was
//    `unwrap_or_else(|| json!({}))`, which cannot tell "no file yet" (starting
//    from `{}` is correct) from "the file is there but did not parse" — and
//    that second case is exactly what Slint's own O_TRUNC window looks like
//    from over here. `{}` plus our key is a document containing ONLY our key:
//    the mirror image of the wipe above. A save we cannot do safely is SKIPPED
//    and logged, never guessed.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
