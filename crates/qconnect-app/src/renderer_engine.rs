//! Engine seam for QConnect renderer-side playback (slice 6).
//!
//! The hard-won renderer orchestration (echo-seek rejection, cursor align,
//! queue materialize, shuffle deferral, load dedup window) lives ABOVE this
//! trait in `qconnect-app` and is written ONLY against these methods plus
//! `QconnectRemoteSyncState`. It must never be re-derived per frontend.
//!
//! Implemented by:
//!   - src-tauri: `CoreBridge` (forwards to `QbzCore` + `Player`)
//!   - qbz-slint: a thin adapter over `runtime.core()` (`QbzCore` + `Player`)
//!
//! Errors are `String` (CoreBridge already returns `String`; the Slint impl maps
//! `CoreError::to_string()`). The two protected bit-perfect audio seams
//! (`play_data` / `play_streaming_dynamic`) are reached ONLY through
//! [`QconnectRendererEngine::start_track_stream`]; they are never modified, only
//! called, and the probe-derived sample_rate/channels/bit_depth must pass
//! straight through (defaulting them silently resamples hi-res).
